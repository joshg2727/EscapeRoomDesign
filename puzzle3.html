Later this night, Poe was to be found nearby in a dangerous state. The man who found him sent a letter to Poe's doctor requesting immediate assistance, however some letters in the note are decoded. Unscramble this letter using the Pigpen Cypher provided to discover what happened to Poe that left him in this state. </p></center>
