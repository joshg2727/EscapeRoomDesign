  <h2>Narrative</h2>
  <p>On September 27, 1849, Poe began a speaking tour in which he was set to travel from Richmond, Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland to New York City. However, Poe never made it past Baltimore. In the six days between his departure from Virginia and his death, there is very little knowledge of the happenings of his travels. Between a doctor's visit prior to his speaking tour and being found delirious on the streets of Baltimore among other mysteries, there have been a wide array of theories that came about regarding Poe's death. The user of this Escape Room will attempt to uncover the famed poet's true cause of death.</p>
  <h2>Puzzles</h2>
  <p>Each puzzle will carry you chronologically through the final week of Edgar Allan Poe. In each setting, you will uncover what could have occured there that potentially lead to his death. I wish you good luck.</p>
