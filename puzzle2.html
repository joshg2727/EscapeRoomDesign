<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have solved the first puzzle and made it to the second room. While Tuberculosis is a common theory behind Poe's death, there were more strange circumstances following his visit to the doctor. Poe travelled to Maryland by railroad - a revolutionary new technology that, at the time, were roughly made and jolted often. Could something have occurred on his railroad trip that caused his delirium? Solve this maze and use the numbers you pass through to decypher the Secret Code Grid and decode another potential cause of death.</p>
